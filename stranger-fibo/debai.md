You will have to calculate `fib(n)` where:

```js
fib(0) = 0;
fib(1) = 1;
fib(n + 2) = fib(n + 1) + fib(n);
```

Write an algorithm that can handle `n` up to `2000000`. n comes from standard input.

Your algorithm must output the exact integer answer, to full precision. Also, it must correctly handle negative numbers as input.

## Input

n < 2000000

## Output

fib(n)
